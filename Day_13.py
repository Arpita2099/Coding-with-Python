# In today coding I am going to code for the Loop in the Python.
# Specially, I am going to code for the For Loop in Python.

# Loops in Python
# Sometimes a programmer wants to execute a group of statements a certain number of times. This can be done using loops.
# Based on this loops are further classified into following types; for loop, while loop, nested loops.

# For Loop
# For loops can iterate over a sequence of iterable objects in Python.
# Iterating over a sequence is nothing but iterating over strings,lists,tuples, sets and dictionaries.

# Let's clear the for loop by doing some of the example:
Name="Arpita Sah"
for i in Name:
    print(i, end="\n")
