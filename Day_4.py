# In the Day-4 of python code.
# Going to learn about the operators in Python.

# Additional Operators
a=10
b=20
print(a+b)
# Substraction Operators
print(b-a)

# Multiplication Operators
print(a*2)

# Divisible Operators
print(b/a)

# Modulus Operators
print(5%3)

# Floor Division Operators
print(a//b)
print(15//6)

# Exponential Operators
print(2**3)

# Create a calculator that can operator the calculation of two number.
a=30
b=20
print(f"Addtion of {a} and {b} is: ",a+b)
print(f"Substraction of {a} and {b} is: ",a-b)
print(f"Multiplication of {a} and {b} is: ",a*b)
print(f"Division of {a} and {b} is: ",a/b)
print(f"Floor Division of {a} and {b} is: ",a//b)
print(f"Square of {a} and {b} is: ",a**b)
print(f"Modulus of {a} and {b} is: ",a%b)
# Here, I created the calculator using the variable and operator. We can also make by using int, intput() function and if, elif but with upto now level.
# I am using the simple way to make calculator which seem that I can step my way step by step from basic to advanced.
# So, today the coding of python is only based on the operators of the python.
# This is all about today coding.
