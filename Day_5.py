# In the day_5 of the coding I am going to solve some of the using print() function, variable, data types, and operators.
# As I am in my beginner level of the python coding I go through doing the simple problem to make regular practice in the coding.

# Write a program in python to calculate the area of rectangle.
length=12
breadth=13
Area_of_rectangle=(length*breadth)
print("Area of the rectangle is: ",Area_of_rectangle)

# Write a program in the python to calculate the area of circle.
pie=3.14
radius=14
Area_of_circle=2*pie*(radius**2)
print("Area of Circle is: ",float(Area_of_circle))

# Write a program in the python to find the sum of three number and their average.
num1=10
num2=20
num3=30
sum=num1+num2+num3
Average=sum/3
print("Sum of the three number is: ",sum)
print("Average of the three number: ",Average)

# Write a program in the python to find the interest were principle, rate, and time is given.
principle=1000
rate=4
time=5
Interest=(principle*rate*time)/100
print("The interest is: ",Interest)

# Write a program to check that the given number is even.
num=12
print(f"{num} is even number: ",num%2==0)

# Write a program in the python which can convert the celcius into farenheit.
celcius=50
farenheit=(celcius*9/5)+32
print(f"{celcius} into farenheit is: {farenheit}")

# String concatination.
A="Arpita"
s="Sah"
print(A+" "+s)

# String Multiplication
str="Hello Ji, Kaise hai aap sabhi."
print(str*10)
