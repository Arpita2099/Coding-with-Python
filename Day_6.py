# Typecasting in Python
# The converstion of one data type into the other data type is known as type casting in python or type conversion in python.
# It also support the various function.
# For instance,
a="5"
b="6"
print(int(a)+int(b)) # Output: 11

# Type of Typecasting: There are two type of typecasting.
# Explicit Conversion: As a programer we are doing conversion.
# For instance,
string="10"
number=3
string_num=int(string)
sum=string_num+number
print("The sum of both is: ",sum) # Output: The sum of both is:  13

# Implicit Conversion: Python do the conversion.
# For instance,
c=10.5
d=6
print(c+d) # Output: 16.5
# Today, coding about the typecasting.
