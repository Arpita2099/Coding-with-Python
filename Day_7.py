# Taking User Input in Python
# In python, we can take user input directly using input() function.
# This input function gives a return value as string/character hence we have to pass that into a cariable

# Syntax of input()
# variable=input()

# But input function returns the value as string. Hence we have to typecaste them whenever required to another datatype.

# For instance,
# If you want to input the integer then, you use this syntax:
num=int(input("Enter any number: "))
print(num)

# If you want to input float then, you can use this syntax:
num1=float(input("Enter any float number: "))
print(num1)

# If you want to input teh string then, you can use this syntax:
string=input("Enter you name ")
print("My name is ",string)

# So, you can input in python with the help of above rule as I applied above.
# This is about the today coding about the input in python.
