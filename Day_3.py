# <class 'complex'>

# Why data types is required: because to print the different types of data in the python.
# Also, importance while doing concatination because while concatination they need the similar types of datatype then only it can perform the concatination in the python.
# And to know that the data type are similar or not you can use the type() function inside the print() function to find the types of data types.
