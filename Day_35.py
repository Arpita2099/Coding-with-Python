# Virtual Environment
# A virtual environment is a tool used to isolate specific Python environments on a single
# machine, allowing you to work on multiple projects with diffrerent dependencies and 
# packages without conflicts. This can be especially useful when working on projects that
# have conflicting package version or packages that are not compatible with each other.

# To create a virual environment in Python, you can use the venv module that comes with 
# Python. Here's  an example of how to create a virtual environment and activate it:

# Create a virtual environment
# python -m venv myenv

# Activate the virtual environment (Linux/macOS)
# source myenv/bin/activate

# Activate the virtual environment (Windows)
# myenv\Scripts\activate.bat

# Once the virtual environment is activated, any packages that you install using pip will be
# installed in the virtual environment, rather than in the global Python environment.
# This allows you to have a separate sset of packages for each projects, without affecting 
# the packages installed in the global environment.

# To deactivate the virtual environment, you can use the deactivate command:

# Deactivate the virtual environment
# deactivate

# The "requirement.txt" file
# In addition to creating and activating a virtual environment, it can be useful to create
# a requirements.txt file that lists the oackages and their versions that your project depends
# on. The file can be used to easily install all the required packages in a nwe environment.
# To create a requirements.tst file, you can use the pip freeze command, which output a list
# of installed packages and their versions. For example:

# Ouput the list of installed packages and their version to file.
# pip freeze > requirements.txt

#  To install the packages listed in the requirements.txt file, you can use the pip install
# command with the -r flag:

# Inatall the packages listed in the requirements.txt file
# pip install -r requirements.txt

# Using a virtual environment and requirements.txt file can help you manage the 
# dependencies for your Python projects and ensure that your projects are portable and can
# be easily set up on a new machine.
